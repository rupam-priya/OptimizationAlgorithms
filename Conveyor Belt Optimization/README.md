In a manufacturing facility, the conveyor belt system needs to be installed, and we need to find the optimal cost of building the same. The solution could be achieved by using Dijkstra's Prim algorithm which is also used to finf shortest distance.
Using Python and networkX, we would specifically identify the edges to be taken into account.
